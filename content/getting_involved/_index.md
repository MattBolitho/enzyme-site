The Enzyme community aims to be open and welcoming, and as an LLVM Incubator Project we follow the [LLVM Community Code of Conduct](https://llvm.org/docs/CodeOfConduct.html). If you'd like to participate, you can do so in a number of ways:

* Join our [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/enzyme-dev)
* Join our weekly [open-design call](https://mit.zoom.us/j/96000853439)
* Participate in development on [Github](https://github.com/EnzymeAD/Enzyme)
